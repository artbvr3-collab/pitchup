/**
 * MODULE: match_lifecycle.application.kick-player-service
 * PURPOSE: Use case — captain removes an accepted player from their match.
 *          Implements `POST /api/matches/:id/kick`: under advisory lock →
 *          captain check → request-exists / belongs-to-match check →
 *          status='accepted' check → live-status check → UPDATE
 *          JR.status='kicked' → `notifyWatching(triggeredByCaptain=true)`.
 *          The kicked player surfaces in `/my-matches → Section Past` as
 *          "You were removed" via the Layer 6 sub-label code path (reads
 *          `JoinRequest.status` directly).
 * LAYER: application
 * DEPENDENCIES (ports): MatchRepository, JoinRequestRepository, WatchRepository
 *                       + notifyWatching helper + withMatchLock
 * CONSUMED BY: app/api/matches/[id]/kick/route.ts
 * INVARIANTS:
 *   - Captain-only. The handler resolves the calling user; the service
 *     verifies that user IS the captain — `NotCaptainError 403`. The kicked
 *     player is identified by `requestId` (mirrors Approve / Reject), NOT by
 *     userId — kicking by userId would race with re-applies. The
 *     `request.matchId === matchId` cross-match guard collapses to 404 so a
 *     direct curl with a stale request id from a different match cannot
 *     escalate into a NotCaptain-on-wrong-match disclosure.
 *   - Status is UPDATE → `kicked` (NOT DELETE). UNIQUE(match_id, user_id) is
 *     preserved so the player can re-apply via the UPSERT path in
 *     JoinService. The row stays in DB and renders in `/my-matches → Section
 *     Past` as "You were removed" (sub-label reads `JoinRequest.status`).
 *   - The freed slot count = `1 + guestCount` of the kicked JR row (guests
 *     ride with their host — spec global.md "Guests"). Captain cannot trim
 *     guests separately; that requires Approve→Kick→re-Approve workflow.
 *   - notifyWatching runs in the SAME transaction (atomic with the kick).
 *     `triggeredByCaptain: true` — the captain self-trigger skip rule from
 *     spec match.md "notify watching" step 4 applies: the captain does NOT
 *     receive a self-push for an action they initiated. Watching players
 *     always get the push regardless of trigger.
 *   - Match must be live (Open/AlmostFull/Full). After `start_time` the
 *     match is considered played — spec §292 makes Kick unavailable; the UI
 *     hides the button via the CTA cascade, the 409 covers direct curls.
 *   - 404 NotInMatchError when the JR is absent OR not accepted (e.g. user
 *     left a moment earlier — race "Leave + Kick" in spec matrix). The
 *     frontend treats both 404 outcomes as success-no-op (the desired state
 *     "player not on roster" is already true). Spec match.md "Idempotency".
 * TODO(Layer 7 — Notifications):
 *   - Insert `notification(type='kicked', user_id=request.userId,
 *     match_id=matchId, body='You were removed from [match]')` INSIDE the
 *     same `tx` (spec "Write ordering: notifications inside transaction").
 *   - Email send to the kicked player — Kick is the only player-removal
 *     event that earns email per spec global.md "Notifications" (approve +
 *     kick + morning reminder). Layer 7 will inject an EmailSender port via
 *     the constructor.
 *   - Watcher inserts + captain self-trigger skip already wired inside
 *     `notifyWatching` — see TODO markers there. Nothing additional here.
 * RELATED DOCS:
 *   - docs/spec/pitchup-spec-match.md → "Reject / Kick / Leave flows",
 *     "Per-endpoint checklist" → POST /kick, "Race scenarios — resolution
 *     matrix" → "Leave + Kick", "notify watching"
 *   - docs/spec/pitchup-spec-global.md → "Guests (+N on join)",
 *     "Notifications" (email allowlist)
