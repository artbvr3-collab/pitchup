/**
 * MODULE: match_lifecycle.domain.watch-repository
 * PURPOSE: Port for "Notify me when a spot opens" subscriptions.
 *          - Layer 4: idempotent delete inside the Join/Approve transactions
 *            (a successful Join wipes the user's Watch for that match in the
 *            same tx; Approve does the same as a safety against a Watch race).
 *          - Layer 5: read-only `countForMatch` + `existsForUserAndMatch` for
 *            the polling lineup snapshot and the RSC viewer-role derivation.
 *          - Layer 6: full WRITE surface for POST/DELETE /watch +
 *            notify-watching one-shot:
 *              · `upsertForUserAndMatch` — INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING,
 *                returns outcome so the service can log "existed" without
 *                surfacing it to the client (idempotent re-subscribe).
 *              · `listForMatch` — collects user ids for the notification
 *                fan-out inside `notifyWatching`.
 *              · `deleteAllForMatch` — bulk delete of all Watch rows for a
 *                match in one statement; called by `notifyWatching` after
 *                the user-id list is captured.
 *              · `listMatchIdsForUser` — unlocked read used by
 *                `ListMyMatchesService` to find matches the user is
 *                watching (drives the `👀 Watching` cards in Section
 *                Upcoming).
 * LAYER: domain
 * DEPENDENCIES: ./match, src/auth/domain/user, src/shared/db/types
 * CONSUMED BY: src/match_lifecycle/application/{join,approve,leave,watch,
 *              unwatch,list-my-matches,notify-watching}-service,
 *              src/match_lifecycle/infrastructure/prisma-watch-repository
 * INVARIANTS:
 *   - `deleteForUserAndMatch` + `deleteAllForMatch` are idempotent: deleting
 *     non-existent rows is a no-op.
 *   - `upsertForUserAndMatch` is also idempotent — an existing row counts
 *     as success (`outcome: 'existed'`); the service maps both branches to
 *     `200 OK`.
 *   - `listForMatch` returns user ids in arbitrary order. Callers are
 *     responsible for any sort they need.
 *   - Spec: match.md → "Watching logic" → "What happens to the Watch record
 *     on Join", "notify watching (DRY sub-operation)", "Per-endpoint checklist"
 *     → POST /watch, DELETE /watch.
 * RELATED DOCS:
 *   - docs/spec/pitchup-spec-match.md → "Watching logic", "Per-endpoint checklist"
