/**
 * MODULE: match_lifecycle.domain.derive-match-change
 * PURPOSE: Pure derivation of a single `matches_changed[]` entry for the global
 *          poll (`GET /api/updates/state`). Given the viewer's relationship to
 *          one match + the `since` cursor, decide whether anything changed in
 *          that window and, if so, which `action` + `my_status` to emit.
 *          Returns `null` when nothing changed (the match is skipped).
 *          Source of truth: spec global.md → "Polling sync" → "`action` — full
 *          enum" table (§410) + "`my_status`" table.
 * LAYER: domain (pure — no I/O)
 * DEPENDENCIES: ./join-request (status / auto-reason types), ./derive-my-status
 * CONSUMED BY: src/notifications/application/updates-state-service.ts
 * INVARIANTS:
 *   - Two change sources, checked in order:
 *       (A) the viewer's OWN JoinRequest transitioned (`updatedAt > since`) —
 *           drives requested / accepted / captain_rejected / match_started /
 *           match_cancelled(pending) / left / request_cancelled / kicked.
 *       (B) the MATCH row changed (`updatedAt > since`) AND the viewer is the
 *           captain or an accepted player — drives match_updated, or
 *           match_cancelled for accepted players (whose JoinRequest does NOT
 *           change on cancel — §401, the signal is `match.cancelledAt`).
 *     (A) takes precedence and returns early; in practice the two are mutually
 *     exclusive (approve/kick/leave touch join_request, edit/cancel touch the
 *     match row — never both for the same viewer).
 *   - `my_status` is computed via `deriveMyStatus` for every case EXCEPT
 *     `kicked`, which the on-read derivation collapses to `none`; the poll
 *     payload instead carries the UI-only `kicked` value to drive the
 *     Upcoming → Past card animation (spec §399 / §421).
 *   - Watching transitions are intentionally NOT emitted — a pure watcher is
 *     neither captain nor accepted (Step B skips) and has no active
 *     JoinRequest (Step A skips). spec §448.
 *   - `admin_deleted` (Layer 9) is out of scope here — it has no DB state to
 *     derive from and carries its own payload semantics.
 *   - Strict `> since` mirrors the notification cursor (`created_at > since`,
 *     spec §365). Boundary double-delivery is harmless: the client reaction is
 *     an idempotent `router.refresh()`.
 * RELATED DOCS:
 *   - docs/spec/pitchup-spec-global.md → "Polling sync" (action enum,
 *     my_status table, "action → notification.type mapping")
 *   - docs/spec/pitchup-spec-match.md → cancel / edit flows
