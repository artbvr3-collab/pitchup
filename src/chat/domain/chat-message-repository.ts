/**
 * MODULE: chat.domain.chat-message-repository
 * PURPOSE: Port for ChatMessage persistence. Chat does NOT take the advisory
 *          lock (spec match.md §546 — chat messages don't mutate slot/status/
 *          roster), so methods do not accept a `TransactionClient`. The
 *          repository is consumed directly by the chat services and by the
 *          read-only `MatchStateService` polling assembler.
 * LAYER: domain
 * DEPENDENCIES: ./chat-message, src/auth/domain/user,
 *               src/match_lifecycle/domain/match
 * CONSUMED BY: src/chat/application/post-chat-message-service,
 *              src/chat/application/delete-chat-message-service,
 *              src/match_lifecycle/application/match-state-service,
 *              src/chat/infrastructure/prisma-chat-message-repository
 * INVARIANTS:
 *   - `insert` returns the persisted row (server-assigned id + createdAt).
 *     Services need both to fan-out a freshly-published payload.
 *   - `softDelete` is idempotent — a second call on an already-deleted row
 *     is a no-op and returns the same row. The route handler still returns
 *     200 so retries on flaky networks are safe (spec match.md captain
 *     moderation is destructive-but-idempotent by design).
 *   - `listForFeed` returns messages in `created_at ASC` order, NOT NULL
 *     `deleted_at` rows INCLUDED — the UI renders tombstones in place
 *     (spec match.md "Captain delete on messages").
 *   - `listForFeed` is the single read entry point used by both the initial
 *     RSC page load (`since = null` ⇒ full history, capped at `limit`) and
 *     the polling delta (`since = ISO ⇒ messages with created_at > since
 *     OR (deleted_at IS NOT NULL AND deleted_at > since)`). The OR-branch
 *     surfaces soft-deletes as delta events even when the message itself
 *     was created before `since` — without it, the frontend would never
 *     learn about a delete that happens later than the original message.
 * RELATED DOCS:
 *   - docs/spec/pitchup-spec-match.md → "Tab Chat", §195 ("Polling for
 *     match state"), §225 (captain delete on Cancelled)
 *   - docs/spec/pitchup-app-map.md → "ChatMessage"
 *   - ADR-0003 (Repository ports + Prisma adapters)
